# Naming Templates

## Why naming templates is matter ?

Naming things is matter, especially in this case. we need to make sure that templates are imported in right order (no matter if **sort import feature** is enabled or not) to make the logical work

## Naming convention

lets make it `<greek alphabet(in kebab case)>.<template name (in kebab case)>.css.ts`

with this convention. we can decide what should be import first by the alphabet part which is also make sure auto sort import doesn't impact final result
